# ***Unauthorized access via Leaked Credentials ⚽️***

*1. After subdomains enumeration, I started fuzzing the directories and finally arrived at a specific path.* <br>

*2. When I opened the desired path, a message was displayed requiring a username and password to access this path.* <br>

*3. I started searching Google and the Wayback Machine and GitHub and all the indexes, but I couldn’t find anything that pointed directly to this particular path.* <br>

*4. I opened the directory in the out-of-scope domains. for one of them, my [Wayback Machine Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/wayback-machine/fpnmgdkabkmnadcjpehmlllkndpkmiak) was activated and some archived paths were detected.* <br>

*5. I opened the archived paths and found a few usernames, passwords, and specific endpoints.* <br>

*6. I replaced them in the subdomain in scope and one of them worked correctly and I got access to the admin panel.*
<br>Now I’m In.
