# ***How Recon Leads to RCE and Many More Vulnerabilities ðŸ©»***

*1. I started with basic subdomain enumeration using tools*
```
$ subfinder -d redacted.com -o subfinder.txt
$ amass enum -d --passive redacted.com -o amass.txt
$ echo redacted.com | assetfinder --subs-only | tee assetfinder.txt
$ cat subfinder.txt amass.txt assetfinder.txt | sort -u | anew subdomains.txt
$ cat subdomains.txt | alterx | anew subd.txt
```
*2. Now, its time to resolve the subdomains and check how many of them are alive or having status code 200.*
```
$ cat subd.txt | httpx -mc 200 | tee live.txt
```
*3. I found that subdomainâ€™s endpoint /teamlevelis hosting the information of all its employees in a hierarchy format.*  <br>

*4. I found that the subdomain itself leaking the PII data of its employees.* <br>

*5. I started fuzzing the subdomain and found an interesting endpoint /hrms which is asking for the employeeâ€™s email address to login/authorize.* <br>

*6. I entered an email ID and without any password or OTP, I logged into their dashboard and was allowed to change the data available on it.* <br>

*7. I started playing with input boxes and first thing I tried inputting a XSS payload `<img src=x onerror=prompt()>` in all froms and submit it. and BOOM* <br>

*8. I logged into the dashboard and found file upload functionality. I have tried to upload a php file and BOOM*
