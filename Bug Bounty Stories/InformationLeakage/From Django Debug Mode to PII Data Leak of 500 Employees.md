# ***From Django Debug Mode to PII Data Leak of 500 Employees***
<br>&nbsp;

## *Recon*
*1. I started with basic subdomain enumeration using tools such as Subfinder, Amass, Assetfinder and Alterx*
```
$ subfinder -d redacted.com -o subfinder.txt
$ amass enum -d --passive redacted.com -o amass.txt
$ echo redacted.com | assetfinder --subs-only | tee assetfinder.txt
$ cat subfinder.txt amass.txt assetfinder.txt | sort -u | anew subdomains.txt
$ cat subdomains.txt | alterx | anew subd.txt
```

*2. Now, its time to resolve the subdomains and check how many of them are alive or having status code 200. I used httpx and then saved the output in a file say live.txt.*
```
$ cat subd.txt | httpx -mc 200 | tee live.txt
```

*3. I have used naabu for port-scanning.*
```
$ cat subd.txt | naabu -top-ports 1000 -o port-scan.txt
```

*4. For the subdomain 3ntern1l.redacted.com, I found two open ports 8443 and 443.*

## *Working with the Subdomain*
- *On the port 8443, I found Django Debug mode Enabled by just adding a random string at the end of the URL*

- *Using the Swagger endpoint, I was successfully able to access the Swagger UI Dashboard.*
- *I was not able to access the API endpoints as they require the authorization token*
- *I know that subdomain is also running on port 443. I navigated to port 443 and found a Login as well as Sign Up page. I immediately signed up and accessed the dashboard.*
- *I found that subdomain is using the same API endpoints of which Swagger UI Dashboard was available to me. In the burp-request, I also found the JWT Token.*
- *I immediately copied the JWT token and pasted on the Swagger UI Dashboard. I was successfully able to access the API endpoints available on the dashboard.*
- *I found 2â€“3 endpoints requires only an id input from the user. I start playing with those endpoints and found that with a change of idðŸ’¥*
### *The data exposed includes the PII data such as first name, last name, professional email address, phone number, etc of more than 500+ employees registered on the subdomain.*
