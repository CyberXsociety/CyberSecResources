# ***How We hacked (bypassed) Admin Panel just by JS file:***

## *1. Introduction*
*Team gave mobile app and website.*</br>
*We didn‚Äôt waste of time on mobile app and decided to work on website.*</br>
*We just tried to find Admin Panel because main domain was just a single page to download the app.*
</br>&nbsp;

## *2. Subdomain Enumeration üòç*
*After brute forcing the subdomains we found that website had a subdomain like that admin.target.com*</br>
*When we visited the subdomain we just got that Login Portal*</br>

## *3. Some Techniques but Nothing* <br>
*a) Couldn‚Äôt brute force the password (Too Many request)*</br>
*b) Directory fuzzing not result.*</br>
*c) There wasn‚Äôt any sign up form to try some bypass ways.*</br>
*d) The website was new so there was not any related URLs/info about it.*</br>
*So what we can do now?*</br>

## *4. Source Code Review üí°*
*Taking a look at the source code is a nice part of finding bugs!*</br>
*When we took a look at page there was just one line that was deserve to focus on*</br>
*and that was a JS file.*</br>

## *5. Source Code Review*
*After opening JS file, First we searched for sensitive words such as:*</br>
**admin, config, password, token, email, .conf**</br>
*Happily when we tried token we found this juicy piece of code:*</br>

## *6. Get bounty üíµ*
*According to end URL part which is addAdmin.php we knew that this is a POST request that will create another admin account*</br>
*So we sent a POST request and response is OK*</br>
*We had full control of Panel and successfully hacked it and got $$$ reward for it.*</br>
