# ***Found +6 DomXSS at different programs üêâ***

*1. Collect as much as you can of subdomains of your targets* <br>

*2. Scan them and see which are alives.* <br>

*3. I use my [own tool](https://github.com/doosec101/swagger_scanner) to find Swagger Ui endpoints.* <br>

*4. With the help with swagger nuclei template was able to discover +100 of my targets using Swagger Ui, But +6 of them was vulnerable to DomXSS.*
