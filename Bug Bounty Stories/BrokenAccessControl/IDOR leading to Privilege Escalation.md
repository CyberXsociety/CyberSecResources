# ***IDOR leading to Privilege Escalation! ü™∞***

*1. I quickly went to the password reset section* <br>
*2. After entering a new password in both input fields, I captured the request.* <br>
*3. The parameters were not so interesting to me, also I check them for other bugs but no success :(* <br>
*4. Anyways I saw a header named ‚Äúuid‚Äù which had my current email.* <br>
*5. I simply created another account and replaced my email inside the ‚Äúuid‚Äù header with this victim mail.* <br>
*6. BOOM!! We just changed the victim‚Äôs password!!*
